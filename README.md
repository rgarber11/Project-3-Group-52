#Project-3-Group-52
This repository includes all of the source code for the Project 3 implementation. 
Main.cpp is the main file where the implementation for the UI is used, and the supporting files contain the Movie data class, Graph data structure, and unordered map data structures.

Datasets includes the original datasets from the MovieLens site, and additional csv files with edited data from the original. Edited meaning: that since the original csv is so large, more csv files
with far less space needs were made for processing within this implementation. (Note: these csv files were parsed via our code as well)

Requires C++17, TermOx (currently a submodule) Signal, nCurses(submodules of that submodule) and MPFR
